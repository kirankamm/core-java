1.1
Ans:
   public static void main(String args [])
   
   public means it is axess or run to the in class and out side class  and static means only works 
   in class and String is the non primitive type Squqr box is there in obejects

1.2
 Class:
 class is collection of the methods,obejectives,varibles,data,keywords give by the users and proses it give the output
  
   
   obeject:
   obeject is  class a number of methods we can use it run it its contains the arrey ,in the arrey parameters are there with seperate them by comma
   
1.3
 Ans:
    JVM:
     Java Vartual machine is  process by runtime and giving the byte code	
      
	  steps of JVM
	       process
           verifys
		   exicute
   
   JRE;Java Runtime environment
     JRE is the JVM + set of liberary
	 
	 
	 JDK:java Development Kit
      JDKis the JRE +  set of liberary
	  
4:

 ex: Parents parents = new Parents();
 
 constructer: is define as the constructer name  same as the calss name it not contians return type is called as constructer 
 
 2 types constructer 
  
  parameteriased constructer:
 constructer is define as the its contains the parents class and child class and new key word ,
 in this helps of to parents class, parethess and semicolom in parthesis  a number of parameters ues and  run it  
 
 defaulte constructer:
   defaulte constructer is the contains the parents class and child class and new key word ,
 in this helps of to parents class, parethess and semicolom in parthesis () we can not use parameters and run it.
 
 
 
  Qun 5
  
   keywords:
   *Is the standard form
   *Limitaion to use
   
   Ex:return,new
   
   this():
   Ex: this.String name= name;
   
    when the complex between in instance variable and parameters that easy find or recognised and problem we can solve

	
	Qun7
	
	Ans:in main method static  the grogramm run time 1st to come to the main method and static is the the information under the class it not to go the  
	
	
	type of methods:
      1: predefined
	  2:users defined
	
	
	predefined is defined as the it is already contain or include in the java.
	
    user defined is define as the user can input to any wods 


Qun no:10
  
   private constuctor:
   private constuctor is use in encapsulation we can not ues out side the class we restrute to the use for sequire   
    
	EX:
	class Hospital{
   private String name;
   private int contactNo;
   private int address;   
	
	}
	public Hosptal( String name int contactNo  int address )
	
	this.name  = name;
	this.contactNo =  contactNo;
	this.address  =  address;
	
	
	
	Qun No: 12
	
	yes we can use instance variable inside the static variables. instance variable is defined
	is decleared the inside the class and out side the all method is called as the instace variable   
	
	Qun No9:
	
	java class loading: is the in calss containing the datatypes,variables,methods,group of codes 
	it runs to load is called as the java class loading
